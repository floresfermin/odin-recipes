    <h1>Spaghetti Puttanesca</h1>
    <img src="./recipes-images/spaghetti.jpg"> 

    <p>  Spaghetti alla Puttanesca is an Italian pasta dish said to have been invented in Naples 
        in the mid-20th century. The name literally means "hooker-style spaghetti" in Italian, 
        but don't get carried away! While the etymology of the name once linked the dish to 
        courtesans of old, as it was said to be a quick dish to make between dates, or because
         it smelled good enough to attract customers from the street, the truth is that neither 
         of these two stories seem particularly convincing.</p>
    
    <p> Food historian Jeremy Parzen, for his part, claims that the name has more to do with the 
        practical use of puttanesca in Italian than its literal definition: Italians use "puttana"
         in a similar way to how English speakers use "shit", to desecrate anything. With this in 
         mind, he theorizes that the name refers to the ingredients and the fact that the dish is 
         made mostly from leftovers or, "shit" lying around.
    </p>    
    <p>  A 2005 article in the Il Golfo newspaper claims that the dish was invented in the 1950s
         by Sandro Petti, co-owner of Rancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and
         late-night cafe, when, near closing time one night, a group of customers ordered food. 
         Since he didn't have many ingredients, he told them he didn't have enough to make a meal,
         but they complained and insisted that he "make any kind of crap". With four tomatoes, two 
         olives and some capers he had on hand, he made a meal for the group and, due to his success, later
         added it to the menu as spaghetti alla puttanesca. This story has not been verified, but I can suggest
         how the dish might have come to be and what it might have been named.

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>60g of canned anchovies</li>
        <li>600g of crushed tomato</li>
        <li>10/12 black olives</li>
        <li>15/20 capers</li>
        <li>3 cayenne chillies</li>
        <li> basil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li> oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To cook the pasta, we put it in abundant boiling water, with a handful of salt and let
         it cook here for about 10 minutes. Until al dente.</li>
        <li>While it cooks, in a wide skillet we heat a drizzle of oil over medium heat. When it is
             hot, add the sliced garlic cloves and the whole cayenne peppers. Let fry for a
              minute, until the garlic begins to brown.</li> 
        <li>Once this is done, we add the anchovies cut into pieces. This is the most characteristic 
            ingredient of spaghetti alla puttanesca. The anchovies will fall apart during cooking and 
            this is normal. We cook a couple of minutes. No more, because we don't want to excessively
             develop its aroma either. Otherwise, the dish could be too powerful. </li> 
        <li> At this point, we add the crushed tomato, the capers and the black olives cut into 
            slices. Mix well with the rest of the ingredients and let cook for about 10 or 15 minutes.
             Until the tomato is well cooked. If you think it's too sour, you can add a small pinch
              of sugar. </li>
        <li>  To finish with the spaghetti alla puttanesca, all that remains is to introduce the pasta
             into the sauce that we have just prepared. You can also add a little of the cooking 
             broth, which will enhance the flavors and also give it a "creamer" touch. Mix, let cook 
             for another minute and plate. We can sprinkle some chopped basil that will give it the 
             final touch.</li>
    
    </ol>
