    <h1>Peperoni Pizza</h1>
    <img src="./recipes-images/peperoni.png">
    
    <p>"Pepperoni pizza originates from North America. It is a pizza with a base
         of tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni, a type of cured salami made 
         from pork and beef mixed and seasoned with paprika. 
         In this recipe I tell you how to make a delicious pepperoni pizza. " </p>

    <p> If we look in the translator or in an Italian dictionary for the meaning 
        of "pepperoni" it is very likely that we will not find it. On the o
        ther hand, if we search for pepperoni it will appear as the plural of peperone 
        (which is peppers). The Americans must have called the sausage pepperoni because 
        they put paprika on the meat to stuff it and thus make this peculiar salami. 
        When cooked it has a very intense flavor. It is not a pizza that is eaten in Italy, although
         there are pizzas with salami of different types that are delicious. We can find pepperoni 
         spicy or not spicy, we can even find it smoked. The choice is up to the consumer. </p>
    
    <h3>Ingrdients </h3>
    <ul>
       <li>100 gr. pepperoni</li>
       <li>100 gr. of salami</li>
       <li> gr. grated mozzarella cheese</li>
       <li> can of crushed tomato</li>
       <li>100 gr. grated parmesan cheese</li>
       <li>1 homemade pizza dough base</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
       <li>Oregano</li>
       <li>Peper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Begin by preparing the homemade sauce for your pepperoni pizza. Although some opt
         for the fried tomato, we prefer the crushed tomato. Add olive oil to a pan and
         when it is hot add the tomato with salt, pepper and oregano to taste, if you wish
         add some fresh basil leaves for more flavor.</li>

        <li>Stir and cook over very low heat until the sauce thickens. If the acidity point 
            of the tomato stands out too much, correct it with a pinch of sugar. When the sauce
             is almost ready, turn on the oven at 200ÂºC.  </li>

    
        <li> Roll out the homemade dough that you have prepared and place it on the tray covered 
            with parchment paper. Prick the dough with a fork so it doesn't rise. Then, cut the 
            pepperoni and salami into thin slices.</li>

        <li> Cover the base with the sauce you have prepared and layer with the grated 
            mozzarella cheese, pepperoni and salami slices. Top with Parmesan cheese
             to taste and place in the oven for 15 minutes or until perfectly golden. </li>

        
    </ol>
