    <p>
        Caprese salad is a typical Italian recipe created on the island of Capri, as the name 
        itself suggests. Between the famous Faraglioni and the well-known Via Krupp, a fresh 
        Caprese salad is a must at lunchtime.

    <p>
        although we know where it came from, the exact origins of the recipe are still unclear. Some
        suggest that it was prepared in a Capri restaurant in the 1920s to promote the futuristic 
        vegetarian cuisine of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto, which called for eliminating 
        pasta in favor of lighter flourless dishes with smaller portions.

        According to popular belief, Caprese salad was created for King Farouk of Egypt who wanted
         to eat "something fresh" after a day at the beach. Although the origins of this dish are s
         till controversial, the flavor of Caprese salad continues to shine on tables in Italy 
         and around the world.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make this caprese salad we must prepare all the ingredients. </li>

        <li> For this Italian salad, I advise you to choose plum tomatoes because they don't expel as much juice.
             Cut the tomatoes into slices, neither too thin nor too thick, and reserve.</li>

        <li> We take the mozzarella cheese and cut it into slices similar to those of the tomato. We booked.</li>

        <li> On the other hand, to season this exquisite caprese salad, we make a preparation with a few
             leaves of chopped fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil, salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
             Another totally valid option is to season the salad with homemade pesto sauce.</li>
             
        <li> Finally, for the presentation of the salad, we take a plate or a flat dish and we
             arrange the ingredients, inserting a slice of tomato, a slice of mozzarella, a fresh 
             basil leaf and so on. Dress with the preparation made previously and sprinkle with a 
             touch of freshly ground peppercorns to complete the decoration of this delicious and 
             irresistible caprese salad. </li>
